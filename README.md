# calendarSync
Calendar Sync is a web app that will compare your calendar to mine, and display times that we could meet.

See the workin project here: https://calendar-sync-blake-wright.herokuapp.com/

This project was build in Django using primarily Python and Javascript. Deployment was done on Heroku.

NOTE: This is not the complete project, this repository only has the files that handle the logic portions of the application.
